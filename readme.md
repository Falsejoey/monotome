### a project by cblgh

i want to start a wiki.

### Reasons behind this urge

* i want to document what i learn so that i don't have to relearn it later
* i want to have a sort-of a spellbook i can use to lookup old incantations instead of having to rediscover them. an
[exocortex](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Exocortex.html)
* a (personal) wiki feels like the kind of [mind-augmenting tool](memory/field%20notes.md) that timers or calendars or trello boards are.
they free up your mental resources so that you can focus them elsewhere, accomplishing more in less time and with less
stress.

so i created this, welcome
