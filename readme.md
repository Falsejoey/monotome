# wikisoft

i wanted to start a wiki so i made this

### Structure
subjects are ordered into a simple directory structure which is mirrored by `index.json`. you can fill `index.json`'s `subjects` by hand if you want to avoid even running a script to use your wiki

you can also run `node generate-structure.js` and it will autopopulate `index.json` for you

this `readme.md` is the start page of your wiki, and each `readme.md` within a subject folder is the overview page for
that subject

#### clone this project and open `index.html` to give it a try
